# youtube-recipe-scraper
The goal with this recipe scraper is to extract data from SRT files and the description from a youtube video regarding a specific recipe. Then using this data and structuring it using AI and sending it to a web app where it is presented in a proper formatting. Ultimately I want to easily import recipes from youtube into a web app.
